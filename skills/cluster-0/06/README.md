### Summary
Using the VS CODE IDE, I accessed my GitHub via my local system. Through this, I was able to write code and push it to github. The code I wrote was to be used with the ESP32 which allowed the LEDs to count in binary from 0 to 7 and then back down from 7 to 0. Before coding, I set up the basic circuitry of the binary counter on two breadboards; one had LEDs and the other had the ESP32 module. This could have been done on one board. At first, I began by coding the ESP32 to turn on all the LEDs, and then afterward, I focused on implementing the logic of the binary counter. The logic to implement the binary count was using modulus to act as a right shift for the bit count. The bits in binary would be shifted to the right.
