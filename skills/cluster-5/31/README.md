### Summary
Creating two identical circuit boards, one serves as a receiver, and one serves as a transmitter. The transmitter sends the color LED that it wants to communicate to the other board, and the receiver then turns on the correct corresponding LED light. This is done by using an IR light and an IR receiver. The transmitter would communicate through the IR light, and the receiver would listen with the IR receiver.
