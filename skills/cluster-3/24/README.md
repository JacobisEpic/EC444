### Summary
Initially, the node was set as the server, while the ESP32 acted as the client. In the next iteration, the ESP32 was the server while the node.js was the client. In both cases, the duration of the blink was communicated from the client to the server so that the blinking LED light on the ESP32 could turn on for that amount of time.
