### Summary
The two sensors I chose were the thermister and photocell. Minor edits were made to ensure that the output from the circuit could be sent in a one-liner. Using socket.io as a way to communicate data from the serial port to the client browser allows for the .html file to display the data in a graph via CanvasJS
