### Summary
The raspberry PI is customized to function as a server and run a node.js file on it. The 32-bit OS system has my personal github repository for EC444 loaded onto it. This enables the raspberry PI to access the node.js file. The node.js file is a simple hello world. Accessing the raspberry pi at the specific port allows one to see the hello world function.
