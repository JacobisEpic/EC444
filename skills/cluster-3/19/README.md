### Summary
The team created a server on internal port 8080 with node.js. One of the member's computers served as a HTTP server. Using a free DDNS service, an account was made. The domain name is http://squigglies.loseyourip.com. Using the node.js server, the server can be accessed on any device regardless of network (even on cellular). The router port forwards to 8080 on the external port of 8081 since this one is not in use. The router connects to the laptop since the laptop acts as a server.
