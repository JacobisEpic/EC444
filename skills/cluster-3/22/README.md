### Summary
Using the Pi camera module and attaching it to the Raspberry Pi has allowed the user to connect to the Pi and get a continuous live stream from the Pi camera to the VLC reader on the local computer. Additionally, this is done by SSH into the pi module by using our own network. That way, we know the network IP address of the pi camera.
