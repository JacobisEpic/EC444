### Summary
For this team skill, the team wired up the optical encoder to the ESP32. An encoder pattern was attached to the wheel, and the optical encoder would detect changes in white and black. This is a method of counting the RPM since a full rotation of a wheel consists of 12. Then, a timer was implemented in the code, and simple arithmetic was done to calculate the speed every 12 rotations of the wheel.
