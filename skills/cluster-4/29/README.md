### Summary
PID is used to make adjustments using data gathered from the sensors. Using the LIDAR sensor, if the distance of the LIDAR from the targeted distance is not 50 cm, either the red or blue LED will shine. If the distance is exactly 50 cm, the green LED will shine. This measurement is done every 100 ms.
