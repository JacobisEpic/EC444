### Summary
For the team skill, we wired up the buggy with an esp as the brains of the vehicle. To go forward, 'w' is pressed on the keyboard, and to go backward, 's' is pressed. To steer, 'a' goes left, and 'd' goes right. We can also go at various speeds as each press of 'w' or 's' increments/decrements the speed.
