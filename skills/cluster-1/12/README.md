# Skill 12

### Summary
The goal of this skill was to perform a simple hardware interrupt. This can be done in two ways. Firstly, using the concept of polling, a button's state would be captured and push the cycle of the LED lights. Another way is when a program is interrupted by the button press and the next button is pushed on.
