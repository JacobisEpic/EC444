### Summary
The goal of the Console I/O is to perform one of the mode tasks. Mode one is simply to turn the built-in ESP32 LED on and off. Mode two is to echo/print whatever is typed on the keyboard to the terminal using the ESP32. Mode three is to convert a typed number to a hex base and echo/print it in the terminal. The USB from the laptop serves as a serial (transmits information one bit at a time sequentially), and then the TX/RX of the ESP32 transmits and receives information.
