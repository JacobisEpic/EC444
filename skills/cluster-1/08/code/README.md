### Summary
The goal of this skill was to measure ambient temperature. To do so, a thermister was incorporated into the voltage divider circuit. The thermister would be connected to the ADC input from one end. Then, the ADC input would convert the voltage reading into temperature and display the units on the terminal. This effectively allowed an individual to monitor the ambient temperature of the room.
