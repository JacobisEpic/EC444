### Summary
Utilizing the ADC input from the ESP32 and the variable resistance from a thermistor, the ambient temperature can be outputted on the terminal. In order for the variable resistance to correspond to the correct temperature in the room, the attenuator value was adjusted accordingly. The thermister continuously detects data. The circuitry has a thermister implemented into a voltage divider.
