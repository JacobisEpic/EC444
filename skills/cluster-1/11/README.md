### Summary
Using the xTaskCreate() function, the goal of the skill was to create a multi-functional program that could fulfill three tasks. The first task would be to have the ESP32 count up in binary using the LED lights on the breadboard. The second task is to reverse the counting direction using a push button. The third task is to light up a blue LED when the lights are counting up and turn the light off on the LED when the count is counting down. Communication between the tasks is done with global variables.
