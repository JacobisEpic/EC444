### Summary

A photocell measures ambient light and quantifies brightness. Similar to the thermister, the photocell generates resistance based on the light it perceives which changes the voltage inputted to the ADC input. Using a voltage divider setup, the photocell is implemented into the circuit. The code does simple computations that outputs a number in the terminal. The brighter the room, the bigger the number and vice versa.
