### Summary
Utilizing an Adafruit 14-Segment Alphanumeric LED, a user can input a message of up to 8 characters to be displayed on the circuit. Since the display is an alphanumeric display, it can display letters and numbers. If the length of the input is longer than four characters (including spaces), the display will scroll to display all characters. Additionally, the LED driver uses MSB. The LED board is powered with a 3.3V input with SCL and SDA pins since these have internal pull-ups.
