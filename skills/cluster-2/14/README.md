### Summary
The skill titled "timer" is actually a stopwatch. This stopwatch has a modulo at 16 which wraps the time around from 0-15 seconds. This time is then communicated with the 14-segment alphanumeric LED board. When the button is pressed, the count resets back to 0. The button functions like an interrupt as it interrupts the counting up.
